# 3300 Project 1 - Milestone 1

## Project Idea:
Choropleth maps of Asian countries colored based on their total population size, median age, and population growth in 2023. Each country will be shaded based on a color gradient (e.g., light colors for low population, darker colors for high population).

## Member Contributions:

**Carter Zhu**:  
I found the World Bankâ€™s world population dataset that we are using to create the visualization and suggested the idea of a choropleth map of world population.

**Nathan Zhang**:  
I helped expand the project idea from just visualizing the populations to adding median age and population growth.

**Siying Cui**:  
I helped expand the project idea by suggesting the inclusion of additional variables such as population growth or splitting the area of the continent to provide a more comprehensive understanding of demographic patterns in our project.

**Michael Glenn**:  
I contributed to discussions that shaped the direction of our project, helping to decide on creating a choropleth map. Additionally, I helped narrow the focus from a global map to specifically visualizing the population of Asian countries.

## Questions:
- Is our project idea complex enough to sustain a full project?
