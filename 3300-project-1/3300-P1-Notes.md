## Project Idea:
Choropleth maps of Asian countries colored based on their total population size, median age, and population growth in 2023. Each country will be shaded based on a color gradient (e.g., light colors for low population, darker colors for high population).

### Possible Additional Variables:
- Gross Domestic Product
- Life Expectancy
- Population Growth Rate  
  [Link to Population Growth Rate Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW?locations=Z4-AS)
- Median Age  
  [Link to Median Age Data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/590942/median-age-of-the-population-in-south-east-asia/)
- Unemployment Rate
- Internet Penetration
- CO2 Emissions per Capita
- Energy Consumption per Capita

### Data Sources:
- Asia Population: [Link](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/asia-population/#google_vignette)
- World Population: [Link](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
- Asian Countries (map): [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asian_countries_by_population)
